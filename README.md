# MOH

CUCM MOH music Upload Will automatically pull from 'files' inside the repo and upload to the servers in USESI environment (CUCM 11.5).  

Depending on where this is run you may have to change the directory in the 'Music.py' file.  Currently it's set to:C:\\Users\\j.kravitz\\Python\\CUCM\\MOH\\files
I will be working on making this dynamic - selecting the current directory this is run in.
